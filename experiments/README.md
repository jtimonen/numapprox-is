# Experiments

## Running an experiment

First set the working directory to one of the experiment directories
(for example `01A-tmdd`). You can replicate
the experiment by running the `*_main.R` in the directory. 

If you want to run one of the TMDD experiments using new simulated data, first run `tmdd_simulate.R`.
