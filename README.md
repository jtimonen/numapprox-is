# numapprox-is
An importance sampling framework for reliable and efficient inference in Bayesian models 
that require numerical approximations, such as solutions of implicitly defined functions. 
Ordinary differential equation (ODE) models are one example.

## Experiments

Code for reproducing the experiments of the paper is in the `experiments` subdirectory. Running
them requires the [odemodeling](https://github.com/jtimonen/odemodeling) R package,
which was developed for these experiments.
